PARALLEL VALIDATION

Validate 2 player fleets simultaneously using parallel strategies.
This is the PRIMARY use case for parallelism in the project.

Called when: Both players click "Ready" in 1vs1 setup phase

Performance:
  * Sequential: ~10ms (validate fleet1, then fleet2)
  * Parallel:   ~5ms (validate both simultaneously on 2 cores)
  * Speedup:    2x

Technical details:
  * Uses Control.Parallel.Strategies (parMap rdeepseq)
  * Each fleet validation is CPU-bound (O(n²) overlap checking)
  * Fully evaluated results (no lazy thunks)

validateBothPlayers :: Fleet -> Fleet -> IO (Bool, Bool)
validateBothPlayers fleet1 fleet2 = do
    -- Validate both fleets IN PARALLEL
    let results = validateParallel validateFleet [fleet1, fleet2]
    return (head results, last results)

-- ============================================================================
-- Single Fleet Validation
-- ============================================================================

{-|
Validate a single fleet (used for AI mode and within parallel validation).

Checks:
  1. Correct count (5 ships)
  2. Correct types (Destroyer, Submarine, Cruiser, Battleship, Carrier)
  3. No overlaps between ships (O(n²) pairwise check - CPU intensive)
  4. All ships in bounds (10x10 grid)
  5. Valid orientations (Horizontal or Vertical only)

Returns: True if ALL checks pass, False otherwise
